# SNAP Policies and Participation: Project Overview
Analyzed data from the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program (SNAP) Policy Database to detect changes in state policies and participation rates over time. Insights include changes within SNAP recipient groups, relationships between different groups of SNAP recipients, relationships between different policies, and identification of policies that might influence participation rates. Python was used to clean data, perorm exploratory analysis, and create data visualizations to detect relationships between different variables. Tableau was used to create a comprehensize dashboard and additional visualizations that provide more detail.

## Tools & Skills
Python Version: 3.11
Tableau

Packages: pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, seaborn, folium, json, sklearn, pylab, statsmodels
* Executed data wrangling and merging operations.
* Derived new variables using .loc to conduct exploratory visual analysis.
* Conduct geospatial analysis using a shapefile to create a choropleth map.
* Perform linear regression analysis and analyze model performance statistics.
* Use elbow technique to prepare data for cluster analysis using k-means algorithm.
* Test for stationarity in data using Dickey-Fuller test and autocorrelation plots.
* Perform differencing to stationaritze data prior to time-series analysis.

## Purpose & Context
I independently sourced relevant and reliable data to educate the general public and policy makers about SNAP. Advanced exploratory analysis techniques were used to gain a deeper understanding of the differences in participation and policies over time. An interactive dashboard was created to easily convey the complexity in the data.

## Data Cleaning & Transformation
Following a comprehensive descriptive analysis of the data, I identified several areas where data cleaning and transformation were necessary. Here's a summary of the changes and modifications that were made:
